To make this application work, you will have to deploy it as an APK (can be done in debug mode) and provide your own Google API key (is found in res/values/google_api_key.xml) for the Google APIs to use. 

Other than that, it should run as is with the Android link as long as you use the correct IP address and port from the android_link.py ROS node and the server you have chosen to use.
