Edge Of Space - 3/8/2015

Project code for the Edge of Space project, an Imperial College London 3rd Year
EIE group project, in conjunction with IBM. 

Although a large proportion of this code has been written or changed by us,
it is heavily based on the work of Dave Akerman  (dave@daveakerman.com). The 
original code can be found at https://github.com/PiInTheSky/pits

This code was a work in progress. We had all functionality working, including
2-way communication with LoRa boards and correct PITS transmission. We were 
undergoing testing when an SD card corrupted and due to time constraints we
reverted to much simpler code. This therefore was not the code actually used
during launch, but it was developed for this purpose. The code used during 
launch was a very minor adaptation of the original mentioned above. 

Compilation should result in a functioning unit, however due to a lack of 
hardware this cannot currently be verified.

Useful tutorial to set up SD card:

Certain libraries are needed to compile this code:
Wiring Pi - http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
Again, due to lack of hardware, am unsure if this is all that are needed.

Due to the heavy and rapid adaptation, there is a variety of confusion and 
overlap within the code, for instance two configuration files. This could be 
very easily streamlined should the hardware become available.
