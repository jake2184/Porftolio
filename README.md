# Portfolio

Collection of example pieces of work

- dist_alg_java:  
	Java implementation of failure detectors, used in distributed algorithms

- dps_using_tbb_cpp:  
	C++ implementations of fourier transforms, optimised with threaded building blocks

- hpce_c++_opencl:
	C++ implementation of the Julia fractal. Given an existing slow implementation, through algorithmic changes and 		        parallelisation great speedups were achieved. 



Additional examples can be found here:

- https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/jr2812/pits  
	C/Python code for the microcontrollers used in a high-altitude balloon project

- on request, examples from private repositories, eg a current robotics project in Python
