# Portfolio

Collection of example pieces of work

- HCR:  
	A group project in Human Centred Robotics, written in Python. I was primarily responsible for the speech recognition modules

- dist_alg_java:  
	Java implementation of failure detectors, used in distributed algorithms

- dps_using_tbb_cpp:  
	C++ implementations of fourier transforms, optimised with threaded building blocks

- hpce_c++_opencl:  
	C++ implementation of the Julia fractal. Given an existing slow implementation, through algorithmic changes and 		        parallelisation great speedups were achieved. 

- PITS (Pi In The Sky):
	A group project, I was the primary software developer. Project in conjunction with IBM. Mostly C, with low-level integration with sensors and LoRa communication modules. Also has (simple) Python scripts, usually for communication 
- LZW:  
	A LZW compressor/decompressor written in C++

- On Request, examples from private repositories, eg my current final year project being written in NodeJS and Android
